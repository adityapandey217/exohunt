## ðŸŽ¤ 5-Minute Demo Script

### Minute 1: Problem & Solution (60 sec)
**You say:**
"The Kepler mission discovered thousands of exoplanet candidates, but manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. ExoHunt uses a hybrid CNN+MLP deep learning model to automatically classify exoplanet candidates from light curves with 95% accuracy."

**You show:**
- Home page hero section
- Quickly scroll through features

### Minute 2: Live Upload (60 sec)
**You say:**
"Let me demonstrate. I'll upload this light curve from KIC 10000162..."

**You do:**
- Navigate to Analyze page
- Upload `10000162.fits`
- Enter period: 3.52
- Click "Predict Exoplanet"

**You say:**
"Notice the real-time prediction happens in under 1 second..."

### Minute 3: Results Analysis (60 sec)
**You say:**
"The model predicted this is a CONFIRMED exoplanet with 98% confidence. Here's the probability breakdown across all three classes..."

**You show:**
- Predicted disposition
- Confidence score
- Class probability bars
- Metadata (KIC ID, duration, data points)

### Minute 4: Interactive Tools (60 sec)
**You say:**
"ExoHunt provides interactive visualization tools for researchers..."

**You do:**
- Click "Advanced Analysis"
- Show interactive light curve
- Zoom into a transit event
- Point out periodic dips

**You say:**
"Researchers can zoom, pan, and explore the data interactively. The system also includes BLS transit detection and phase-folding capabilities."

### Minute 5: Dashboard & Wrap-up (60 sec)
**You say:**
"The dashboard provides an overview of all predictions..."

**You show:**
- Navigate to Dashboard
- Point out statistics cards
- Show recent predictions table

**You say:**
"In summary: ExoHunt combines state-of-the-art deep learning with interactive research tools, making exoplanet detection faster and more accessible. Thank you!"

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Backup Plan

### If Live Demo Fails
- [ ] Have screenshots ready in a folder
- [ ] Have pre-recorded video (record during practice)
- [ ] Have curl commands ready to show API
- [ ] Can show Jupyter notebook training results

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Backend not responding:**
```bash
# Kill and restart
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
cd exodetect && python manage.py runserver
```

**Frontend not loading:**
```bash
# Kill and restart
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

**CORS errors:**
- Check Django terminal for error messages
- Ensure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in settings.py includes `http://localhost:5173`

**File upload fails:**
- Check file size (<100MB)
- Ensure FITS file is valid
- Check Django terminal for error messages
